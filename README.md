## How to build the mod yourself
Download the repository

Change the directory to the repository source folder containing `gradlew.bat`  
Run the command `gradlew build`  
The output jar should be in `/build/libs/Hypnotic-(version).jar`  
  
## How to import the project into Eclipse  
Install Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/ide/  
Download and extract the Hypnotic client source code  
Open Command Prompt/Terminal  
Navigate to where you extracted the Hypnotic Source  
Run `gradlew eclipse`, then, optionally, run `gradlew gensources`  
Import the folder into Eclipse as `Existing Projects into workspace`  
Click on the arrow next to the Debug button in the toolstrip, then click `Debug configurations`
